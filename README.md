**Task 1**
The processArray function uses the map method to transform each number in the input array, it squares even numbers and triples odd numbers. This results in a new array of numbers with the modified values.

**Task 2**
The task is to create a function createUserProfiles that takes two arrays, one with original names and the other with modified names, and returns an array of objects where each object includes an id (starting from 1), the originalName, and the modifiedName. The function ensures that each original name is paired with its corresponding modified name in the resulting array of user profiles.

**Task 3**
The formatArrayStrings function ensures the input arrays have equal lengths, throwing an error if they do not. It then uses the map method to convert each string to uppercase if the corresponding number is even, or to lowercase if the number is odd.
